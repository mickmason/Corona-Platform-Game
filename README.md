## Web-Authoring-Assignment
Is an assignment to implement designs as HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
In it I make heavy use of CSS flexbox. I also used SASS. 
Please see the /mock-ups directory for the designs and then various HTML pages and /css/style.css

###Design
I also produced the site and brand designs.

##Corona platform game

This is an assignment using the Corona mobile app development platform.

I did a game - it's a go at one of the old arcade games. See Space War - A user and data model.pdf for a game and implementation description.

If you want to run it you will need to get [Lua Glider](http://www.mydevelopersgames.com/Glider/).
